# Terminal-Todolist-Manager

## Description

This is a simple terminal tool that can help you to manage your task &amp; todo.

## Development advances

none, I haven't start it yet.

## Tips

At least now, I will only add some features that I need, if you like this tool and want to add some features, you can fork it or just open an issue :)

And because there's no enough time for me to learn how to write a program with GUI using cpp, so this tool might only support working at terminal for a long time XD.

Also, I'll try to make it like gdb, you can just input a single English letter and then start some intereaction.

## Todo

- [x] start this project.
- [ ] [todo.md](todo.md)
